Problem Statement in README. Streams consist of RGB and there are two channels.

Problem Statement;
Let's assume there are two separate infinite sources of data. 
Data is arriving "simultaneously" into our system as two streams via two channels: Channel 1 and Channel 2.
    
The data could be of three types: R, G and B. 
 
Each data element should have two properties: channelNumber and uniqueID.
 
These three types of Data are arriving in a random sequence on the two channels.

This program creates pairs of "same types" arriving on two channels in their "order of arrival".
